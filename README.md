# Auto - lib dataset analysis

## Description

This project aims at helping an electric car sharing service company  investigate a claim about the blue cars using the Autolib dataset. 

The hypothesis to be tested is: 

H0 : The mean number of blue cars taken from postal code 75015(area X) during the weekend is  the same as the mean number of cars taken from postal code 75017(area Y) during the weekend. 

H1 : There is a difference between the  mean number of blue cars taken from postal code 75015(area X) during the weekend and the mean number of blue cars taken from postal code 75017(area Y).
